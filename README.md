# Object-Seeker — Based on Machine Learning Project (Object’s shape recognition).

 Developed a real-time shape detection system using OpenCV, capturing video from a webcam and implementing 
color filtering, contour detection, and shape recognition.

 Enabled user interaction through adjustable color thresholds, providing a practical demonstration of computer vision 
and image processing skills.
